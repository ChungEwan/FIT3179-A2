                <p id="center-text">There are many metro systems around the world. This visualisation explores the development of metro systems over time, as well as their current distribution. The map shows the location of each metro system. Adjust the map area to zoom in on specific regions.</p>

                <p class="left-p">The majority of metro systems are found in <span class="asia">Asia</span>, <span class="europe">Europe</span> and <span class="north-america">North America</span>. The number of metro systems has steadily increased since the 1970s, with different continents contributing to this growth at various times.</p>

                <p class="right-p"><span class="north-america">North America</span> and <span class="europe">Europe</span> saw the early development of metro systems, followed by <span class="south-america">South America</span>. The development of metro systems in <span class="asia">Asia</span> and <span class="africa">Africa</span> is more recent. Many metro systems have also been expanded in recent years.</p>

                <div id="bubble-plot-dropdown"></div>
                <p class="left-p">There is a clear trend of longer metro systems having a larger number of stations. As the length and number of stations in a metro system increase, the annual ridership generally rises, with few exceptions. Malaysia, however, has a low annual ridership relative to its system length and number of stations. Details of a specific continent or country can be seen using the legend and dropdown menu respectively.</p>

                <p class="right-p">There are many countries with a single metro system. Countries with multiple metro systems are generally larger in area and population. Malaysia has only one metro system, which is RapidKL.</p>
